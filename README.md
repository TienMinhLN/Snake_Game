# Snake_Game
An implementation of the classic Snake game using turtle graphic Python.

# Including 5 steps:
  1. Create a snake body
  2. Move the snake
  3. Control the snake
  4. Detect collision with food
  5. Create a scoreboard
  6. Detect collision with wall
  7. Detect collision with tail

# Outcomes:
  - Demonstrates Python programming skills including game loops, tracking variables, display updating, input detection, and game logic.
  - Developed reusable, inheritable classes encapsulating key attributes and behaviors of game objects like snake, score, or food.
